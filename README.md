# 🧠 Frontend Deep Dives

A growing collection of my explorations, experiments, and insights into **JavaScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, and modern **frontend architecture**.

This is my public engineering journal — a space where I document everything that makes me pause, think, or say *“Wait, that’s interesting.”*  
Sometimes it’s a deep technical breakdown. Sometimes it’s a mental model that helped something finally click.  
Other times, it’s just a small snippet that changed how I think about the frontend.

## 📘 Purpose

This repository documents the **“why”** behind frontend engineering decisions, patterns, and internals — but it’s not limited to that.  
It’s open-ended by design: anything I find insightful, complex, elegant, or worth understanding deeply — it belongs here.

I write to:
- Clarify my own mental models  
- Revisit and refine my understanding over time  
- Share knowledge in a way that’s simple yet technically rigorous  
- Build a long-term reference base that other developers can learn from

## 📂 Structure (Flexible by Intent)

The repo is organized by broad domains, not fixed topics.  
New folders and areas will evolve naturally as I explore more.
